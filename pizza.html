    <p>Pizza is an iconic Italian dish consisting of a flat base of leavened dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature. Originating in Naples, Italy, between the 16th and mid-18th centuries as a simple flatbread for the local populace, it has since evolved into a globally popular and versatile food with countless regional variations, including thin Neapolitan crusts, New York-style slices, and Chicago deep-dish.</p>
