    <h1>Our solar system</h1>

    <p>
        The solar system consists of the Sun and everything that orbits, or travels around, the Sun.
        This includes the eight planets and their moons, dwarf planets, and countless asteroids,
        comets, and other small, icy objects. However, even with all these things, most of the
        solar system is empty space.
